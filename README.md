This is an open source rendering engine for learning. In the future,various rendering functions will be added continuously. As it is a project for learning, performance overhead will not be considered.

`DistEngine` will include various lighting models and rendering functions in the future, such as real physics rendering, cartoon rendering, and water rendering. DXR ray tracing, SSGI, SH and other global lighting technologies.
